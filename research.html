                    <p class="research__description">Abalones are sea snails or molluscs otherwise commonly called
                        as ear shells or sea ears. Because of the
                        economic importance of the age of the abalone and the cumbersome process that is involved in
                        calculating it,
                        much research has been done to solve the problem of abalone age prediction using its
                        physical measurements
                        available in the UCI dataset. This paper reviews the various methods like decision trees,
                        clustering, SVM using Tomek links,
                        CGANs and CasCor used in an attempt to solve it. Furthermore, in contrast to previous
                        research that saw this as a classification
                        problem, this paper approaches it as a linear regression problem and analyses the results.

                    <p class="research__description">Natural Language Processing is an active and emerging field of
                        research in the computer sciences. Within it is the subfield of
                        text simplification which is aimed towards teaching the computer the so far primarily manual
                        task of simplifying text, efficiently. While handcrafted
                        systems using syntactic techniques were the first simplification systems, Recurrent Neural
                        Networks and Long Short Term Memory networks employed in
                        seq2seq models with attention were considered state-of-the-art until very recently when the
                        transformer architecture which did away with the computational
                        problems that plagued them. This paper presents our work on simplification using the
                        transformer architecture in the process of making an end-to-end
                        simplification system for linguistically complex reference books written in English and our
                        findings on the drawbacks/limitations of the transformer during the
                        same. We call these drawbacks as the Fact Illusion Induction, Named Entity Problem and Deep
                        Network Problem and try to theorize the possible reasons for them. </p>
